	*
	*		[] The property has a valid range
	*
	*		-	If the new value is a number and:
	*

	*
	*			+ If the new value is greater than the max value, then the max value is assigned.

	* <b>[Cases for skipping Value Validation for "published" Property]</b>
	*
	*		[] CASE A: Common Case
	*
	*		-	The new value is not checked for valid data type.
	*
	*		-	Skipped when a value is simply being delivered to a browser. (e.g. Color value, Class string, Width, Height, etc.)
	*
	*		[] CASE B: The property has a valid range
	*
	*		-	The range's min value is not checked if it is less than the range's max value.
	*
	*		-	Skipped when a float is passed for the property of type Integer.
	*
	*		[] CASE C: The property has a valid range and is of type String
	*
	*		-	The new value is not checked if it is in the valid range.
	*
	*			e.g. "Pineapple" is not checked if it is in the valid range ["apple" "orange" "banana"]
